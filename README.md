This assignment was a simple project to launch a crowdsale for a coin.

The Kasei coin contract set up a simple coin with name symbol and initial supply. The code compiled correctly

The Kasei coin crowdsale contract set up the initial ground to launch the sale of the kasei coin. The code also successfully compiled

The final contract was the Kaseicoincrowdsale deployer. This contract compiled successfully to deploy the crowdsale.

Now that the crowdsale is ready to go, I used Ganache and Metamask to launch the coin. The the demo video in this repo for a live demonstration.
